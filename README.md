# MoreWorldOptions
A mod for Minecraft wich adds options to customize and manage worlds

It permits to:
- Copy, zip and unzip worlds.
- Rename world's name and folder.
- Add resources packs to automatically load with the world.
- Add a short description to a world to remember what you did in its world.
- Easy enable/disable commands (and maybe more features in a future release).
- Display a warning when you are with the wrong version of Minecraft for a save.
- Display a warning when you've forgotten a mod for a save, if a mod version has changed or if a mod will be added to the save.
- Change the icon of a world and put a image of you because you like your face.

It will permit to:
- Change default gamemode of a world, generation settings, etc...

This mod is side client only, Minecraft will crash if you try to run this on a dedicated server.
The mod will automatically display a warning if it isn't up-to-date.
You can always remove or re-use this mod, it will keep the world's data saved forever.
The mod is avaible in English and French.

It is currently avaible in 1.7.10, 1.8.9, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, but the too old versions will be updated later when I made changes in the mod.

Modders:
- You can simply use this mod by adding this in your mods folders, without anything, it will permit to you to organise your work !
